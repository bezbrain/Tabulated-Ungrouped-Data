# Mean, Median and Mode of Tabulated Ungrouped Data

This is a web app built to aid the challenges that could be faced when solving Tabulated ungrouped data. This can be used to solve for mean, median and mode of all Tabulated Ungrouped Data provided that all data are real numbers.

Even if you know how to solve, this web app allows quick solution and avoids errors that could be inevitably made.

## Limitations

The following are some aspects of mean, median and mode that this web app can not solve:

1. It can not find the median of Untabulated Ungrouped data, especially when there are two mmedian values that are different numbers. E.g. Find the median of 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.

   Above, the median values are 7 and 8 hence, median = (7 + 8) / 2 = 7.5

   In the case above, the web app is not designed to solve correctly. But it can definitely solve for mean and mode of Untabulated Ungrouped Data, but it would be advisable to input the untabulated data into a table so errors will be avoided.

2. The web app is not designed to solve Tabulated Grouped Data.
